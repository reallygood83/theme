# SharedSessionsLibrary.tsx - Critical Fixes and UI/UX Improvements

## 🚨 Critical Errors Fixed

### 1. Undefined `activeTab` Variable Error
**Problem**: Lines 695 and 700 referenced `activeTab` variable that was never defined
- ❌ `{activeTab === 'sessions' ? '공유 세션을 불러오는 중...' : '토론 주제를 불러오는 중...'}`
- ❌ `{activeTab === 'sessions' ? (...) : (...)}`

**Solution**: Removed all `activeTab` references and simplified conditional logic
- ✅ Direct display of loading message for shared sessions only
- ✅ Removed tab-based logic that doesn't belong in SharedSessionsLibrary component

### 2. Misplaced Topics Logic
**Problem**: Component contained topics-related code that belonged elsewhere
**Solution**: Focused component solely on shared sessions functionality
